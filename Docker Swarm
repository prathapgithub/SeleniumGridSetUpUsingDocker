Docker Swarm - Deploying a Selenium grid

Objective : To be able run more than 10 browsers and using multiple machines(Server1,2).


Pre Req.  - 

Docker Swarm requires few ports to be open for it to work. These are
-TCP port 2377. This port is used for communication between the nodes of a Docker Swarm or cluster. It only needs to be opened on manager nodes.
-TCP and UDP port 7946 for communication among nodes (container network discovery).
-UDP port 4789 for overlay network traffic (container ingress networking).


Install 
First install docker on all 2 machines.eg Server 1,2
> curl -SsL https://get.docker.com | sh

Then add the ubuntu user to the docker group, so we don’t need to use sudo everytime we use the docker command
> sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

On Server 1
> docker swarm init --advertise-addr=82.66.x.x   // Here 82.66.x.x is the public IP of the machine.

Now docker swarm is ready and nodes can connect to it, ssh into the Server 2 grid machine and run the following command
On Server 2
> docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-5rm2sib935txv5k13j6leaqsfuuttalktt7jv4s55249izjf54-8ia31tagc4sbehqeqiqst4jfz 172.30.x.x:2377
> docker info


Run the following command to deploy docker swarm  -- https://goo.gl/Fsq6fu
> docker stack deploy --compose-file grid.yaml tangoCharlie


To view status of the docker swarm
> docker stack ps tangoCharlie


To shut down docker swarm
> docker stack rm tangoCharlie

To debug a specific container
> docker logs -f <container-id>

To leave docker swarm, type the following command both on manager node and worker node
> docker swarm leave —force
